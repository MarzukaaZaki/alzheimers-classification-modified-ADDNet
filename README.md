# Alzheimer's Disease Classification using ADD-Net
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook presenting a modified version of the ADD-Net architecture for Alzheimer's disease classification. 

# Paper
The ADD-Net architecture is based on the research outlined in the following paper:

# Dataset
To reproduce the results and evaluate the performance of the modified ADD-Net architecture, the publicly available Kaggle dataset used in the paper has been utilized. The dataset contains MRI scans of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease grouped into 4 classes:

# Modifications Made to the Original ADD-Net
## Exploring Different Techniques to Solve Class Imbalance

## Adding Another Path to the Model
This step is done to extract global features from the MRI images. There are 4 convolution blocks similar to the ADD-Net. Each uses a 12 x 12 filter.
